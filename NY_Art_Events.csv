"An Elegant Evening of Boleros, Brazilian & Latin Jazz",2017-11-11T22:30:00,"Singer Maria Alejandra Rodriguez hails from Venezuela, but the music she sings has an international influence that features tinges of bossa nova, cha cha cha, boleros, Latin jazz and other modern arrangements for a style all its own. In this show at  Club Bonafide in New York City, this seductive South American songstress presents selections from her latest album, Aqui y alla, on which she arranged, composed and produced most of the tracks.Her music has a style of its own but always rooted in Venezuelan traditional music blended with tinges of bossa nova,Cha cha cha, Boleros, Latin jazz and other modern rhythms in her arrangements. Her voice stands out for its beauty, tuning and cool touch with a deep feeling. Now, she unfolds her new musical phase in a more artistic and complete way both as a musician and a singer being the female voice of the venezuelan cuatro.In 2010, she left for The United States to keep on growing musically. There she explored the local circuit interpreting her own music as a singer songwriter. Among her successful presentations were the full house shows in Miami, Florida where she performed at concert halls like Books & Books, Van Dyke Café, and Teatro Para Todos, Hoy Como Ayer, Miami Hilton Intercontinental Wynwood Kitchen and Bar, MOCA Museum of Contemporary Art, North Miami. She also performed sold out in New York at Terraza Seven, El Taller Latinoamericano, Casa Mezcal, Antibes Bistró and Shrine World Music Venue.María Alejandra Rodríguez settled in Mérida, ‘The City of Gentlemen’, wishful to perform for Venezuelans. In June 2015, she performed with the Aragua Symphony Orchestra playing her own songs. She participated in two important jazz festivals: the Saveurs Jazz Festival in Segré, and Wolfi Jazz in Normandy, France where she was accompanied by the excellent trumpeter Nicolás Folmer in July of this year. She is currently promoting her latest outing entitled “Aquí y allá” where she debuts as arranger and composer of most tracks, and producer.

PRIVE GROUP Presents:
THE ATTIC ROOFTOP SATURDAYS
Join us each and every Saturday at the beautiful and exclusive Attic Rooftop!
The team that brought The DL and Dinner on Ludlow to the Lower East Side has recently built a rooftop lounge in Hell's Kitchen with sweeping views of Manhattan. The 5,000 square foot bi-level venue, boasting indoor and outdoor space, is located in the penthouse of the Hilton Garden Hotel at 251 West 48th Street near 8th Avenue.  The DL’s Mino Habib and NYC nightlife veteran Paul Seres are at the helm of the space located on the 15th and 16th floors of the property.
Renowned designer Marc Dizon (Hakkasan Las Vegas, Revel, The Darby) was brought in to renovate and redesign the space and took his inspiration from the golden era of Hollywood. The 16th floor rooftop celebrates the bold patterns and relaxed environment of Beverly Hills pool lounges and outdoor gardens while the lower level lounge, with floor to ceiling glass windows, is inspired by the robust architecture of Richard Neutra and the post contemporary Hollywood Hills vernacular.  It's a cozy lounge with a sunken living room feel.  The color palette is silver and grey with warm woods.  Large bars on each level, plush seating, a DJ booth with state of the art sound system and multiple screens integrated  into the design for corporate branding and event branding are some highlights of the space.

Al Martin’s name is synonymous with comedy in New York City, and is responsible for launching the careers of many top comedians working today. Martin’s first venture in the comedy club business was in 1988 when he established the New York Comedy Club out of a need to help and showcase talented comedians. An accomplished comedian himself, Al was a National Headliner with numerous television credits such as The Joan Rivers Show, Geraldo and Evening At The Improv. Al was always more than just a comedian; he was an activist for the comedy community serving as Vice President of the Professional Comedians Association, and was instrumental in the organization dedicated to bringing health insurance and improving working conditions for comics. Although performing was a love for Martin he found his niche as a comedy club owner. He soon found himself helping his fellow comedians that he had once worked beside. Sarah Silverman, Lisa Lampanelli, Brett Butler, Tracy Morgan and Wanda Sykes are just a few comedians who have graced his stages over the years. New York Comedy Club became the first comedy club with two showrooms in 1997. Al was one of the first club owners to embrace diversity in the comedy world by establishing the first Latino Comedy Night at New York Comedy Club. He’s also facilitated and welcomed to his stage shows featuring gay, urban and Asian communities. In 2000 Martin opened New York Comedy Club in Boca Raton, which he ran successfully until late 2006. With the success of two clubs Al decided to expand his brand and in 2003 opened Broadway Comedy Club, located in the heart of Times Square. Martin again took a risk in opening Broadway Comedy, the only bi- level entertainment complex with three showrooms in NYC, serving over 600 comedy lovers from around the world nightly. In 2005 he partnered with Barry Katz, executive producer of NBC’s Last Comic Standing to run Boston Comedy Club, giving Martin the bragging rights to being the first person to run three comedy clubs in New York City. In the Summer of 2012 Martin expanded his comedy ventures into Greenwich Village, in New York City with the opening of Greenwich Village Comedy Club, from day one the club has been filled every night with a lively downtown crowd and top comedians making them laugh! Martin’s clubs attract comedy fans from around the world including some of the biggest celebrities from Jay-Z & Beyonce, Andre Aggasi, Jimmy Fallon, Montel Williams, and Harry Connick Jr. On stage or behind the scenes, Al Martin will go down in history as the King of New York Comedy. Martin is a brilliant thinker and innovator of his time, and has made New York City the World’s Capital of Comedy.",https://www.eventbrite.com/e/broadway-comedy-club-all-star-comedy-times-square-nyc-discount-tickets-tickets-38142973661?aff=ebapi

FAQs
Are there ID or minimum age requirements to enter the event?
Of course not! It's just a play. That having been said, it may not be the best idea for kids; it's a little complicated, and there's a lot of stuff that happens. We're not gonna spoil it. Just do us a favor, and don't bring in a small child. There's loud noises, and small children cry. Everyone cries. Some more often than others. Help me.
What are my transportation/parking options for getting to and from the event?
As always, we're killing it. The Jay St.-Metrotech stop on the A, F, or R puts you only a few blocks away. There's also a paid parking lot across the street if you're the one person in New York City who drives. You could also just take a car of some kind. Sit back, relax, let someone else get you where you want to go. It's delightful.
What can I bring into the event?
Yourself, a coat, donations. Really anything within reason. We just ask that you don't bring any food or drink (besides bottled water) into the theater, because soda is loud and so are snacks.
How can I contact the organizer with any questions?
You can email joseph@bestintentionstheater.com with anything you need, including advice on which cardigan to buy. We here at Best Intentions Theater Company love cardigans.
Are tickets transferable?
Sure, why not. Just let us know at joseph@bestintentionstheater.com (since we're keeping a list at the door) and then forward the emailed ticket to whoever you want to have it, and we'll let them on through. If you're buying the ticket for someone else, you can just put their name on it during the purchasing process and skip all of this. Go you!
Is it ok if the name on my ticket or registration doesn't match the person who attends?
Sure! We'll just lightly interrogate you to make sure that you didn't kill someone for their ticket.
Do I have to bring my printed ticket to the event?
No! Show us on your phone. You can print if you want, but why bother? Save a tree.
Is the theater accessible?
Everyone can come to space with us. We will also ask you during the ticketing process whether you will be requiring accessible seating so that we can make sure you're taken care of.
What's the refund policy?
We don't offer refunds, and here's why: all no-show tickets will be given away at curtain to artists at the Schermerhorn and other waitlisters. We wanted to do something just in case we once again sold out of tickets before all of our patrons could source the money, since we're all artists and we're all really struggling here. That having been said, if you need to switch your ticket to a different night, please email us at joseph@bestintentionstheater.com and we will do our best to accomodate you. If you promise not to be mad if we've already sold out the other performance, then we'll try not to show how thrilled we are that we once again sold out.",https://www.eventbrite.com/e/updown-herethere-tickets-38927086965?aff=ebapi

Theatre at Gallatin Presents: The Crucible ,2017-11-11T14:00:00,"Set during the 1692 witch trials in Salem, Massachusetts, Arthur Miller's modern masterpiece The Crucible takes us on a thrilling and terrifying journey into the soul of American identity. The questions at stake in this searing drama-how to maintain honesty in a dishonest political culture, what happens when suppressed desires are laid bare, where do we turn when authority has been rendered meaningless-are as dynamic and relevant now as they were when Miller wrote it in the early 1950s. An ensemble of 12 Gallatin students will bring Miller's text to life in an intimate, stripped-down production co-directed by Kristin Horton and Ben Steinfeld.

Jane Monheit & Tony DeSare - PAC the House Series,2017-11-11T20:00:00,"









As the kick-off performance in HACPAC’s inaugural PAC the House series, this duo lights up the stage for a magical evening of music. Inspired by great cabaret singers of the past, the sultry vocalist Monheit joins pianist, singer, and songwriter DeSare for an evening of American standards and new favorites, plus some surprise revisions of classics. Expect some Sinatra from Ol’ Blue Eyes interpreter DeSare.
Jane Monheit, a Grammy-nominated jazz and pop vocalist, has collaborated with John Pizzarelli, Michael Bublé, Ivan Lins, Terence Blanchard, and Tom Harrell. She has recorded many songs from the Great American Songbook and considers Ella Fitzgerald her inspiration. Much of the year she tours with her band, but also performs with major symphony orchestras throughout the country.
Tony DeSare is a jazz singer, pianist, and songwriter who was named a “Rising Star” Male Vocalist in the Downbeat Critics Poll. Along with Harry Connick Jr. and Michael Bublé, he is a “neo-traditional” stylist, covering old and new pop and jazz standards, with special emphasis on Frank Sinatra.






PAC the House: Mission Statement
The mission of the PAC the House series is to present Bergen County audiences with an array of distinctive acts that may not appear on other area stages. The City of Hackensack and the Main Street Business Alliance, which co-sponsor the PAC the House series, carefully vet the performers to ensure a variety of cultural backgrounds and disciplines and to cultivate a hip ambiance for the redeveloping downtown. In the intimate Hackensack Performing Arts Center, the PAC the House series presents well-known performers as well as up-and-coming artists who promise to become new favorites.

The emerging choreographers who participate in the HATCH Series vary in age, perspective and technique. The Works believes that each of their voices deserves a platform for mentorship and performance. The dances offered range from solo to group pieces, some accompanied by live music or actors. The series has presented over 1,000 choreographic works.",https://www.eventbrite.com/e/hatch-presenting-series-tickets-39485483143?aff=ebapi

THURSDAY OCTOBER 26TH, 2017 - 9:45PM Mike Cannon Comedy Central 


Mike Cannon is a New York City based comedian and a delightful human being. He thinks being a good human being is more important, but for the purposes of this advertisement will keep his thoughts focused to comedy. Mike was a finalist in the 2016 (and 2014) New York Comedy Festival’s “NY’s Funniest” contest and made his stand up television debut in March 2017 on AXS Gotham Comedy Live. He has recently appeared as a regular guest on Fox’s Red Eye, as a panelist on Comedy Central’s The Nightly Show with Larry Wilmore, TruTV’s Top Funniest, MTV’s Failosophy, MTV’s Money From Strangers, MSG’s The Bracket and has been a contributing writer/performer for MTV2’s Guy Code. He currently is a regular guest on several Sirius/XM Radio shows including Opie Radio, The Jim Norton and Sam Roberts Show, Bennington, The Compound Media Network, tons of popular podcasts as well as hosting two of his own – Mike and Tim Visit Earth and Irish Goodbye Podcast. Previously Mike hosted a popular weekly web-series called “The Weed News with Mike Cannon” and his conspiracy theory podcast “Deep Inside the Rabbit Hole.” He was also a co-host of Cosmopolitan Magazine’s web-series Sexy vs Skanky and a featured performer on VH1’s “Why Am I Still Single?” Mike regularly tours the country, but when he is home in New York City he plays all the major clubs and is always working on his act. It makes no difference to him whether he’s performing in a bar, an elevator (done that twice), trying jokes out on his friends, or bothering strangers on the subway for loose change or a sandwich. Comedy is his life, and he is dedicated to making the majority of you laugh and the rest of you confused, yet oddly satiated. He also isn’t sure if he used the word satiated correctly.

Al Martin’s name is synonymous with comedy in New York City, and is responsible for launching the careers of many top comedians working today. Martin’s first venture in the comedy club business was in 1988 when he established the New York Comedy Club out of a need to help and showcase talented comedians. An accomplished comedian himself, Al was a National Headliner with numerous television credits such as The Joan Rivers Show, Geraldo and Evening At The Improv. Al was always more than just a comedian; he was an activist for the comedy community serving as Vice President of the Professional Comedians Association, and was instrumental in the organization dedicated to bringing health insurance and improving working conditions for comics. Although performing was a love for Martin he found his niche as a comedy club owner. He soon found himself helping his fellow comedians that he had once worked beside. Sarah Silverman, Lisa Lampanelli, Brett Butler, Tracy Morgan and Wanda Sykes are just a few comedians who have graced his stages over the years. New York Comedy Club became the first comedy club with two showrooms in 1997. Al was one of the first club owners to embrace diversity in the comedy world by establishing the first Latino Comedy Night at New York Comedy Club. He’s also facilitated and welcomed to his stage shows featuring gay, urban and Asian communities. In 2000 Martin opened New York Comedy Club in Boca Raton, which he ran successfully until late 2006. With the success of two clubs Al decided to expand his brand and in 2003 opened Broadway Comedy Club, located in the heart of Times Square. Martin again took a risk in opening Broadway Comedy, the only bi- level entertainment complex with three showrooms in NYC, serving over 600 comedy lovers from around the world nightly. In 2005 he partnered with Barry Katz, executive producer of NBC’s Last Comic Standing to run Boston Comedy Club, giving Martin the bragging rights to being the first person to run three comedy clubs in New York City. In the Summer of 2012 Martin expanded his comedy ventures into Greenwich Village, in New York City with the opening of Greenwich Village Comedy Club, from day one the club has been filled every night with a lively downtown crowd and top comedians making them laugh! Martin’s clubs attract comedy fans from around the world including some of the biggest celebrities from Jay-Z & Beyonce, Andre Aggasi, Jimmy Fallon, Montel Williams, and Harry Connick Jr. On stage or behind the scenes, Al Martin will go down in history as the King of New York Comedy. Martin is a brilliant thinker and innovator of his time, and has made New York City the World’s Capital of Comedy.",https://www.eventbrite.com/e/greenwich-village-comedy-club-all-star-comedy-downtown-nyc-discount-tickets-tickets-38143800133?aff=ebapi

Forbidden NYU 2017 (Saturday Show),2017-11-11T20:00:00,"The College of Arts and Science Theater is proud to present NYU's beloved parody show!  Our little cherub of a show has officially crossed the threshhold into adulthood, and this year, we're exploring what sort of shenanigans this Barely Legal babe can get into. Forbidden NYU sports hilarious Broadway show tune parodies and extraordinary talent (imagine that!), all the while lovingly poking fun at New York City's favorite university... between 4th and 8th streets.
This year, Forbidden NYU will be performing some of the classics you adore (One Gay More, Seasons of Loans) and a swanky new song or two, all in this laughter provoking production. This show is a MUST-SEE for anyone who has ever even heard of NYU or New York or who just knows what a University is. Forbidden NYU is proven to be more satisfying than sitting down for a Tinder date with Joan Torch on a Friday night. tl;dr: We sing funny songs about NYU. Come see our show please! ____________________________________

Christmas at the Court of Henry VIII,2017-11-11T20:00:00,"Missa Tecum Principium – Robert Fayrfax
Pre-Concert Lecture 7:00 pm
Christmas courts were among the most splendid seasonal celebrations, and one of the few times a year that Henry VIII would have had a hand in the liturgical and musical planning of the many masses and offices. In the early years of his reign, the compositions of court composer and royal favorite Robert Fayrfax (1464-1521) would have figured prominently in these events. Fayrfax’s music is intensely spiritual, and the perfect musical complement to the glorious architecture of the chapels, churches, and cathedrals for which it was composed. Join us for a performance of Fayrfax’s splendid five-voice festal mass, the antiphon Eterne laudis lilium, composed for Henry’s mother Elizabeth of York, and hauntingly beautiful liturgical chant from the Sarum Graduale. 
Polyhymnia is supported, in part, by a grant from the New York State Council on the Arts with the support of Governor Andrew Cuomo and the New York State Legislature and by public funds from the New York City Department of Cultural Affairs in partnership with the City Council.",https://www.eventbrite.com/e/christmas-at-the-court-of-henry-viii-tickets-36592925425?aff=ebapi
