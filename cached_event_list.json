Martin\u2019s first venture in the comedy club business was in 1988 when he established the New York Comedy Club out of a need to help and showcase talented comedians. An accomplished comedian himself, Al was a National Headliner with numerous television credits such as The Joan Rivers Show, Geraldo and Evening At The Improv. Al was always more than just a comedian; he was an activist for the comedy community serving as Vice President of the Professional Comedians Association, and was instrumental in the organization dedicated to bringing health insurance and improving working conditions for comics. Although performing was a love for Martin he found his niche as a comedy club owner. He soon found himself helping his fellow comedians that he had once worked beside. Sarah Silverman, Lisa Lampanelli, Brett Butler, Tracy Morgan and Wanda Sykes are just a few comedians who have graced his stages over the years. New York Comedy Club became the first comedy club with two showrooms in 1997. Al was one of the first club owners to embrace diversity in the comedy world by establishing the first Latino Comedy Night at New York Comedy Club. He\u2019s also facilitated and welcomed to his stage shows featuring gay, urban and Asian communities. In 2000 Martin opened New York Comedy Club in Boca Raton, which he ran successfully until late 2006. With the success of two clubs Al decided to expand his brand and in 2003 opened Broadway Comedy Club, located in the heart of Times Square. Martin again took a risk in opening Broadway Comedy, the only bi- level entertainment complex with three showrooms in NYC, serving over 600 comedy lovers from around the world nightly. In 2005 he partnered with Barry Katz, executive producer of NBC\u2019s Last Comic Standing to run Boston Comedy Club, giving Martin the bragging rights to being the first person to run three comedy clubs in New York City. In the Summer of 2012 Martin expanded his comedy ventures into Greenwich Village, in New York City with the opening of Greenwich Village Comedy Club, from day one the club has been filled every night with a lively downtown crowd and top comedians making them laugh! Martin\u2019s clubs attract comedy fans from around the world including some of the biggest celebrities from Jay-Z & Beyonce, Andre Aggasi, Jimmy Fallon, Montel Williams, and Harry Connick Jr. On stage or behind the scenes, Al Martin will go down in history as the King of New York Comedy.

Martin\u2019s first venture in the comedy club business was in 1988 when he established the New York Comedy Club out of a need to help and showcase talented comedians. An accomplished comedian himself, Al was a National Headliner with numerous television credits such as The Joan Rivers Show, Geraldo and Evening At The Improv. Al was always more than just a comedian; he was an activist for the comedy community serving as Vice President of the Professional Comedians Association, and was instrumental in the organization dedicated to bringing health insurance and improving working conditions for comics. Although performing was a love for Martin he found his niche as a comedy club owner. He soon found himself helping his fellow comedians that he had once worked beside. Sarah Silverman, Lisa Lampanelli, Brett Butler, Tracy Morgan and Wanda Sykes are just a few comedians who have graced his stages over the years. New York Comedy Club became the first comedy club with two showrooms in 1997. Al was one of the first club owners to embrace diversity in the comedy world by establishing the first Latino Comedy Night at New York Comedy Club. He\u2019s also facilitated and welcomed to his stage shows featuring gay, urban and Asian communities. In 2000 Martin opened New York Comedy Club in Boca Raton, which he ran successfully until late 2006. With the success of two clubs Al decided to expand his brand and in 2003 opened Broadway Comedy Club, located in the heart of Times Square. Martin again took a risk in opening Broadway Comedy, the only bi- level entertainment complex with three showrooms in NYC, serving over 600 comedy lovers from around the world nightly. In 2005 he partnered with Barry Katz, executive producer of NBC\u2019s Last Comic Standing to run Boston Comedy Club, giving Martin the bragging rights to being the first person to run three comedy clubs in New York City. In the Summer of 2012 Martin expanded his comedy ventures into Greenwich Village, in New York City with the opening of Greenwich Village Comedy Club, from day one the club has been filled every night with a lively downtown crowd and top comedians making them laugh! Martin\u2019s clubs attract comedy fans from around the world including some of the biggest celebrities from Jay-Z &amp; Beyonce, Andre Aggasi, Jimmy Fallon, Montel Williams, and Harry Connick Jr. On stage or behind the scenes, Al Martin will go down in history as the King of New York Comedy. Martin is a brilliant thinker and innovator of his time, and has made New York City the World\u2019s Capital of Comedy.</SPAN></P>"}, "id": "38076477770", "url": "https://www.eventbrite.com/e/broadway-comedy-club-all-star-comedy-times-square-nyc-discount-tickets-tickets-38076477770?aff=ebapi", "start": {"timezone": "America/New_York", "local": "2017-11-10T21:00:00", "utc": "2017-11-11T02:00:00Z"}, "end": {"timezone": "America/New_York", "local": "2017-11-10T23:00:00", "utc": "2017-11-11T04:00:00Z"}, "created": "2017-09-20T13:28:37Z", "changed": "2017-10-06T20:23:22Z", "capacity": 20, "capacity_is_custom": true, "status": "live", "currency": "USD", "listed": true, "shareable": true, "online_event": false, "tx_time_limit": 480, "hide_start_date": false, "hide_end_date": false, "locale": "en_US", "is_locked": false, "privacy_setting": "unlocked", "is_series": true, "is_series_parent": false, "is_reserved_seating": false, "source": "create_2.0", "is_free": false, "version": "3.0.0", "logo_id": null, "organizer_id": "332000851", "venue_id": "16131401", "category_id": "105", "subcategory_id": "5010", "format_id": "6", "resource_uri": "https://www.eventbriteapi.com/v3/events/38076477770/", "series_id": "38076425614", "logo": null}, {"name": {"text": "All American Male - New York, NY", "html": "All American Male - New York, NY"}, "description": {"text": "Get ready to blush, scream and have a great time with the sexy All American Male strippers.

Told through interweaving strands, it's a ensemble play about home, Mars, and how to tell the difference.\n\nWritten by Jonathan Young\nDirected by Joseph Kevin Coles\n\nFEATURING:\nMaddie Browning\nBailey Hawthorne\nKatherine Freel\nNell Kessler\nJonathan Young\nSam Richardson\nFelix Birdie\nCaroline Smith\nSam Krapels\n\nFAQs\nAre there ID or minimum age requirements to enter the event?\nOf course not! It's just a play. That having been said, it may not be the best idea for kids; it's a little complicated, and there's a lot of stuff that happens. We're not gonna spoil it. Just do us a favor, and don't bring in a small child. There's loud noises, and small children cry. Everyone cries. Some more often than others. Help me.\nWhat are my transportation/parking options for getting to and from the event?\nAs always, we're killing it. The Jay St.-Metrotech stop on the A, F, or R puts you only a few blocks away. There's also a paid parking lot across the street if you're the one person in New York City who drives. You could also just take a car of some kind. Sit back, relax, let someone else get you where you want to go. It's delightful.\nWhat can I bring into the event?\nYourself, a coat, donations. Really anything within reason. We just ask that you don't bring any food or drink (besides bottled water) into the theater, because soda is loud and so are snacks.\nHow can I contact the organizer with any questions?\nYou can email joseph@bestintentionstheater.com with anything you need, including advice on which cardigan to buy. We here at Best Intentions Theater Company love cardigans.\nAre tickets transferable?\nSure, why not.

It's just a play. That having been said, it may not be the best idea for kids; it's a little complicated, and there's a lot of stuff that happens. We're not gonna spoil it. Just do us a favor, and don't bring in a small child. There's loud noises, and small children cry. Everyone cries. Some more often than others. Help me.</P>\n<P><STRONG>What are my transportation/parking options for getting to and from the event?</STRONG></P>\n<P>As always, we're killing it. The Jay St.-Metrotech stop on the A, F, or R puts you only a few blocks away. There's also a paid parking lot across the street if you're the one person in New York City who drives. You could also just take a car of some kind. Sit back, relax, let someone else get you where you want to go. It's delightful.</P>\n<P><STRONG>What can I bring into the event?</STRONG></P>\n<P>Yourself, a coat, donations. Really anything within reason. We just ask that you don't bring any food or drink (besides bottled water) into the theater, because soda is loud and so are snacks.</P>\n<P><STRONG>How can I contact the organizer with any questions?</STRONG></P>\n<P>You can email joseph@bestintentionstheater.com with anything you need, including advice on which cardigan to buy.

Martin\u2019s first venture in the comedy club business was in 1988 when he established the New York Comedy Club out of a need to help and showcase talented comedians. An accomplished comedian himself, Al was a National Headliner with numerous television credits such as The Joan Rivers Show, Geraldo and Evening At The Improv. Al was always more than just a comedian; he was an activist for the comedy community serving as Vice President of the Professional Comedians Association, and was instrumental in the organization dedicated to bringing health insurance and improving working conditions for comics. Although performing was a love for Martin he found his niche as a comedy club owner. He soon found himself helping his fellow comedians that he had once worked beside. Sarah Silverman, Lisa Lampanelli, Brett Butler, Tracy Morgan and Wanda Sykes are just a few comedians who have graced his stages over the years. New York Comedy Club became the first comedy club with two showrooms in 1997. Al was one of the first club owners to embrace diversity in the comedy world by establishing the first Latino Comedy Night at New York Comedy Club. He\u2019s also facilitated and welcomed to his stage shows featuring gay, urban and Asian communities. In 2000 Martin opened New York Comedy Club in Boca Raton, which he ran successfully until late 2006. With the success of two clubs Al decided to expand his brand and in 2003 opened Broadway Comedy Club, located in the heart of Times Square. Martin again took a risk in opening Broadway Comedy, the only bi- level entertainment complex with three showrooms in NYC, serving over 600 comedy lovers from around the world nightly. In 2005 he partnered with Barry Katz, executive producer of NBC\u2019s Last Comic Standing to run Boston Comedy Club, giving Martin the bragging rights to being the first person to run three comedy clubs in New York City. In the Summer of 2012 Martin expanded his comedy ventures into Greenwich Village, in New York City with the opening of Greenwich Village Comedy Club, from day one the club has been filled every night with a lively downtown crowd and top comedians making them laugh! Martin\u2019s clubs attract comedy fans from around the world including some of the biggest celebrities from Jay-Z & Beyonce, Andre Aggasi, Jimmy Fallon, Montel Williams, and Harry Connick Jr. On stage or behind the scenes, Al Martin will go down in history as the King of New York Comedy.
